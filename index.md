# DevSecOps Curriculum üíª
>> Made by 2025 University of Washington Informatics Capstone Team

>> Not sponsored by Boeing anymore

Welcome to our open-source DevSecOps curriculum!

This comprehensive resource is designed to equip new graduates, companies, professors, students, and self-learners with practical skills in DevSecOps, thereby bridging the knowledge gap in its principles and practices. Our curriculum prepares students for a smooth transition from academic learning to the professional environment by focusing on real-world applications.

## Why DevSecOps and CI/CD in Academia? üéì
The tech world is rapidly evolving, and with it, the requirements of the software industry are changing at an unprecedented pace. Traditional academic curricula often lag behind, particularly in areas like DevSecOps and CI/CD practices. This creates a significant skills gap for graduates entering the industry, who find themselves unprepared for the demands of modern software development and deployment. Key insights from our research highlight this disconnect:

- **Skills Gap**: As per the [Veracode Global Skills Survey](https://www.veracode.com/blog/security-news/veracode-survey-research-identifies-cybersecurity-skills-gap-causes-and-cures), about 70% of respondents stated that new graduates did not receive adequate training for their current positions. This gap is particularly evident in DevSecOps, where the integration of security in the development pipeline is crucial yet often overlooked in academic settings.

- **Demand for Cloud Skills**: Institutions struggle to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud skills. Reports by 451 Research and Robert Half International show a significant portion of organizations and IT leaders citing a lack of skills in managing cloud deployments.

- **Security Risks**: The skills gap in DevSecOps and cloud technology can lead to severe security risks, with data breaches often resulting from misconfigured access controls. A staggering 80% of companies experienced a data breach between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to such issues.

- **Lack of Practical Exposure**: Students often graduate with coding skills but lack exposure to best practices and industry tools for deploying software in production, especially using cloud technologies. This lack of practical, hands-on experience creates a steep learning curve when entering the industry.

- **Cost and Accessibility of External Resources:** Many existing online courses on cloud technologies and DevSecOps are expensive, making it difficult for students to access quality education in these areas.

Our curriculum aims to fill this void by providing up-to-date, practical training in DevSecOps and CI/CD practices. By integrating our modules into existing courses, professors can enrich their curriculum, preparing students for the challenges of modern software development and making them valuable assets to the industry from day one.

To understand the skills gap that new graduates face, refer to our [User Research](./docs/other/research/user-research).
